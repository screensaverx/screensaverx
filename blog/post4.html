						<p>
						Streaming media is multimedia that is delivered and consumed in a continuous manner from a source, with little or no intermediate storage in network elements. Streaming refers to the delivery method of content, rather than the content itself.
						<br><br>
						Distinguishing delivery method from the media applies specifically to telecommunications networks, as most of the traditional media delivery systems are either inherently streaming (e.g. radio, television) or inherently non-streaming (e.g. books, videotape, audio CDs). There are challenges with streaming content on the Internet. For example, users whose Internet connection lacks sufficient bandwidth may experience stops, lags, or slow buffering of the content. And users lacking compatible hardware or software systems may be unable to stream certain content. With the use of buffering content just a few seconds in advance, the quality can get much better.
						<br><br>
						Livestreaming is the real-time delivery of content during production, much as live television broadcasts content via television channels. Livestreaming requires a form of source media (e.g. a video camera, an audio interface, screen capture software), an encoder to digitize the content, a media publisher, and a content delivery network to distribute and deliver the content.
						<br><br>
						Streaming is an alternative to file downloading, a process in which the end-user obtains the entire file for the content before watching or listening to it. Through streaming, an end-user can use their media player to start playing digital video or digital audio content before the entire file has been transmitted. The term "streaming media" can apply to media other than video and audio, such as live closed captioning, ticker tape, and real-time text, which are all considered "streaming text".
						<br><br>
						Streaming is most prevalent in video on demand and streaming television services. Other services stream music. Video game live streaming uses streaming for online gaming.
						<br><br>
						Video streaming servers are system software that allow users to stream videos regardless of the operating systems. Some videos streaming servers are OS independent based on Linux and can be installed on any machine. Few others are meant for specific platforms such as Windows, Linux or Mac.
						<br><br>
						The server software that provides and manages the video media content remotely called Video Streaming Servers.  Not all the video players can work with the video streaming servers instead of that it needs a perfect video player that can work with the remote servers to buffer and play it without downloading such as VLC. This method also protects the publisher to protect their content from piracy. Video media server utilizes particular calculations to pack the media document or information for exchange over the system or Internet association.
						<br><br>
						Video streaming is a sort of media streaming in which a user can stream the videos saved on the Video streaming servers. The user can use its local player or web player to stream the media files from remote video streaming servers through the internet or local network. Such servers allow watching videos without being downloaded on a local desktop machine or Smartphone.
						<br><br>
						For example, YouTube, Dailymotion, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu these are all video on demand sites where you can watch video free or after subscription. These big names use the Video streaming servers for creating Video on demand (display) (VOD) call. VOD allows users to select and watch videos or listen to audio content such as music, movies and TV shows whenever they want rather waiting for some specific broadcast time.
