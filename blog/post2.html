						<br>
						<p>
						What is OTT platform & what does OTT stands for? Explore the meaning and definition of Over The Top with its working and why it matters to your video business.
						Over The Top, also known commonly as OTT, is a technology that enables content owners to manage the process of delivering video content across multiple devices using the internet. OTT is quickly gaining attraction as a viable alternative to traditional cable television programming.
						<br><br>
						This new trendsetter of OTT platform streaming is particularly popular among teenagers due to the availability of new web series, tv shows, play stations, and what not! The meaning or interpretation of OTT has bridged the possibility to watch preloaded television episodes or on any kind of OTT content an unlimited number of times. All of these are structured in a large & centralized library of multilingual movies.
						<br><br>
						With all of this information, you might be curious to learn more about what does this "OTT" actually means, right? An OTT media service is any online content provider that offers streaming media as a standalone product/service. The term is commonly applied to video-on-demand platforms, but also refers to audio streaming or real-time-based platform streaming solutions. Usually, traditional media distribution routes such as telecommunications networks and cable television providers are bypassed by OTT services. The best highlight is, as content owners you can provide the entire service whenever you wish to use it, or else you can also allow your users to download videos and play them in offline mode too. All that it takes is to have a stable internet connection; either locally or through a mobile network.
