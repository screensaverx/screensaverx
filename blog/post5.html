						Free-to-air (FTA) services are television (TV) and radio services broadcast in clear (unencrypted) form, allowing any person with the appropriate receiving equipment to receive the signal and view or listen to the content without requiring a subscription, other ongoing cost, or one-off fee (e.g., pay-per-view). In the traditional sense, this is carried on terrestrial radio signals and received with an antenna.
						<br><br>
						FTA also refers to channels and broadcasters providing content for which no subscription is expected, even though they may be delivered to the viewer/listener by another carrier for which a subscription is required, e.g., cable television, the Internet, or satellite. These carriers may be mandated (or OPT) in some geographies to deliver FTA channels even if a premium subscription is not present (providing the necessary equipment is still available), especially where FTA channels are expected to be used for emergency broadcasts, similar to the 1-1-2 (112) emergency service provided by mobile phone operators and manufacturers.
						<br><br>
						On the other side, free-to-view (FTV) is generally available without subscription, but it is digitally encoded and may be restricted geographically.
						<br><br>
						Free-to-air is often used for international broadcasting, making it something of a video equivalent to shortwave radio. Most FTA retailers list free-to-air channel guides and content available in North America for free-to-air use.
						<br><br>
						In simple terms, viewer do not have to pay to view the FTA channels. All he needs is the FTA reciever (entire set with DISH and the FTA reciever set top box). Free to air is an expression used to describe both television and radio broadcasts that are not encrypted. This enables anyone with a satellite dish to pick up these programs without subscribing to a cable company. When first radio and then television began, virtually all programs on major networks were free to air and could be listened to or viewed by anyone in close enough range to broadcast antennas. Today most networks, particularly in the US, are unavailable unless one has cable or satellite dish service, which is able to break encrypted codes. Even free to air programming may be difficult to obtain if it is broadcast via a satellite and one does not own a satellite dish. Very few programs or stations use older methods of broadcasting, thus the famous TV rabbit ear antennas have lost their function.
						<br><br>
						With radio, there are still many free to air broadcasts available without subscribing to a satellite radio service. In fact, most popular radio programs are still broadcast in a free to air format, though many argue listening to the radio is not exactly free. With the exception of public radio, one must endure constant interruptions from commercial breaks, making satellite radio a more pleasant option for some. Many would rather pay a fee that allows them access to uninterrupted programming, than to have to listen to commercials.
						<br><br>
						Though free to air programming may be free to watch, it is not free for the broadcasting company. All broadcasting radio and television stations must pay licensing fees to legally broadcast. Some pirate radio and television stations exist, but the location of such broadcasting is usually discovered and shut down.
