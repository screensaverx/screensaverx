						<h3><span class="color-text">STARTUP </span> INDIA</h3>
						<br>
						<p>

						<br><br>
						Startup India is a Government of India flagship initiative to build Startups and nurture innovation. Through this initiative, the Government plans to empower Startup ventures to boost entrepreneurship, economic growth and employment across India. The Government's Action Plan will help accelerate the growth of Startups throughout India, across all important sectors in Tier 1, 2 and 3 cities, including semi-urban and rural areas and includes promoting entrepreneurship among SCs/STs and women communities.
						<br><br>
						Startup India is about creating prosperity in India. Many enterprising people who dream of starting their own business lack the resources to do so. As a result, their ideas, talent and capabilities remain untapped and the country loses out on wealth creation, economic growth and employment. Startup India will help boost entrepreneurship and economic development by ensuring that people who have the potential to innovate and start their own business are encouraged with proactive support and incentives at multiple levels.
						<br><br>
						The Startup India Action Plan was unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 16th January, 2016 to highlight several initiatives and schemes proposed by the Government of India to build a strong eco-system to nurture innovation and empower Startups across India. The 19 point Action Plan envisages several incubation centres, easier patent filing, tax exemptions, ease of setting-up of business, a INR 10,000 crore corpus fund, a faster exit mechanism, among others. Startup India campaign has received worldwide support for its attempt to bring Startups to the forefront of India's growth story. It allows entrepreneurs to focus on their core business (instead of time-delaying regulatory compliances) while empowering them with a strong eco-system to support their creativity and growth.
						<br><br>
						<h2 class="title title-page">Features and Benefits</h2>
						Some of the salient benefits extended to the entities which are recognized as startups by the DPIIT are enlisted below:
						<br><br>
						#1 Self-certification of compliances under various laws
						Under the Startup India scheme, the startup entities shall be allowed to self-certify their compliances under few labour and environment laws as notified by the government. Such benefits are given to the startups in order to ensure their business efficiency, effectiveness and to keep their focus on the core business with relatively low cost on compliances.
						<br><br>
						#2 Intellectual Property Rights Benefits
						In order to promote startups and recognize their business models, Startup India provides new startups with a few intellectual property rights benefits which are stated as follows:
						<li>The patent application applied by a startup is fast-tracked for examination and disposal by the Government.
						<li>Entitlement of rebate up-to 80% as compared to other entities in the process of filing patents.
						<li>Entitlement of a rebate of 50% in the trademark filing process vis-Ã -vis other companies.
						<li>The Central Government bears all the facilitation costs for startups.
						<br><br>
						#3 Tax Exemption
						The startups which are recognized by the DPIIT are entitled to apply for an exemption of 100% income tax under Section 80-IAC (Deduction in respect of specified Business) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 for a period of 3 (three) years out of 10 (ten) years since the entity's incorporation/registration, subject to certain conditions as notified by the Government from time to time. 
						<br><br>
						#4 Relaxation in Public Procurement Norms
						It is to be noted that ordinarily whenever a tender is floated by a Government entity or Public Sector Undertaking, the eligibility criteria only calls for entities who have prior experience or prior turnover in lieu of such work. This practice prohibits or restricts Startups from even participating in the bidding of such tenders.
						<br><br>
						#5 Fast Track Exit Option/Winding Up
						The Startups are also known as "fast track firms" as notified by Ministry of Corporate Affairs are granted permission which enables the Startups to wind up their operations within a period of 90 (ninety) days.
