						<p>
						<b>CONTENT POLICY</b>
						<br><br>
						www.FreeTV.in is a free service for communication, self-expression and freedom of speech. We believe www.FreeTV.in increases the availability of information, encourages healthy debate, and makes possible new connections between people. It is our belief that censoring this content is contrary to a service that bases itself on freedom of expression. However, in order to uphold these values, we need to curb abuses that threaten our ability to provide this service and the freedom of expression it encourages. As a result, there are some boundaries on the type of content that can be hosted with www.FreeTV.in. The boundaries we've defined are those that both comply with legal requirements and that serve to enhance the service as a whole. If you encounter a blog/post that you believe violates our policies, please report it to us at <a href="#">[FreeTV at outlook . com]</a> with the link of that particular blog/post. We will try to remove that post at earliest.
						<br><br>
						<b>CONTENT LIMITATIONS</b>

						<br><br>
						Phishing and Spam: We take the safety of our members seriously and work to prevent attempts to compromise their privacy or security.

						<b>ENFORCEMENT OF CONTENT POLICY</b>
						<br><br>
						Please report suspected policy violations to us at <a href="#">[FreeTV at outlook . com]</a>. Our team reviews such complaints of policy violation. If any blog post or blogger (a.k.a. blogion) does not violate our policies, we will not take any action against the blog or blog owner. However, if we find that a blogion or a blog post does violate our content policies, we take one or more of the following actions based on the severity of the violation:
						<ul>
							<li>  Delete the blog/post with or without prior intimation. </li>
